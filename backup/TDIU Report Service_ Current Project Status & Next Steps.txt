Current Infrastructure (CloudFormation Summary) 
The current AWS infrastructure includes: 
3 S3 buckets for document storage and processing
3 Lambda functions for core functionality 
CloudTrail for compliance logging 
IAM roles with appropriate permissions 
Initial CloudFormation template documentation 
The system is ready for the next phase of development, focusing on the client portal and Claude AI integration. 
Session Management Strategy 
For future development sessions: 
1. Use the CloudFormation template for continuity 
2. Follow the session management prompt template 
3. Focus on one specific goal per session 
4. Document progress and update CloudFormation after each session 
This methodical approach will ensure consistent progress and maintain a comprehensive documentation of the system as it grows.
