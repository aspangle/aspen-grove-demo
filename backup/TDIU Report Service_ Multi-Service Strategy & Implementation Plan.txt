1. Security Framework: Consistent security controls across all services 
2. Authentication System: Single Cognito implementation for all services 
3. User Interface: Integrated Amplify frontend with service-specific modules 
4. AI Processing: Shared Claude integration with service-specific prompts 
5. Data Storage: Consistent S3 structure with service-specific buckets 
6. CloudFormation: Single template with resource definitions for all services
Service-Specific Extensions 
For each new service, the implementation includes: 
1. Database Extensions: Service-specific tables or buckets 
2. Lambda Functions: Service-specific processing logic 
3. Claude Prompts: Specialized AI prompts for each service 
4. UI Components: Service-specific interface elements 
5. Analytics: Service-specific usage and performance tracking 
CloudFormation Strategy for Multi-Service Implementation 
As services are added, they will be incorporated into the CloudFormation template:
Revenue Stability Analysis 
The multi-service approach significantly improves revenue stability. Analysis of various scenarios shows: 
Scenario 1: Seasonal TDIU Report Decline (40% Drop) 
In this scenario, TDIU report volume drops by 40% (from 40 to 24 reports).
