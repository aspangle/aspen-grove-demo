Prompt Engineering for TDIU Reports 
Effective prompt engineering is critical for accurate document analysis and report generation. The system will use specialized prompts for different document types and processing stages: 
1. Medical Record Analysis Prompt 
2. Employment History Analysis Prompt 
You are a medical document analyzer for TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) claims. You are reviewing medical records for a veteran seeking VA disability benefits based on unemployability. 
Please analyze the following medical record excerpt: 
[DOCUMENT_CONTENT] 
For each medical condition mentioned, provide: 
1. Condition name and diagnosis codes (if available) 
2. Date of diagnosis or documentation 
3. Treating provider information 
4. Symptoms and severity indicators 
5. Functional limitations described (especially related to employment) 
6. Treatments prescribed and their effectiveness 
7. Prognosis or expected duration 
8. Direct quotes from the record that support TDIU eligibility 
Format your response as structured JSON with fields for each category. Include a "relevance_score" from 1-10 for each condition's impact on employability.
3. TDIU Report Generation Prompt 
You are an employment history analyzer for TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) claims. You are reviewing employment records for a veteran seeking VA disability benefits based on unemployability. 
Please analyze the following employment document: 
[DOCUMENT_CONTENT] 
Provide the following analysis: 
1. Complete employment timeline (with dates, employers, positions, and salary if available) 
2. Job requirements for each position (physical, cognitive, educational) 
3. Evidence of accommodations or limitations in the workplace 
4. Pattern of decreasing hours, earnings, or responsibilities over time 
5. Gaps in employment and stated reasons 
6. Terminations, resignations, or job changes related to disability 
7. Direct quotes that support inability to maintain substantially gainful employment 
Format your response as structured JSON with sections for each employment period. For each position, include a "sustainability_assessment" indicating whether the veteran could likely continue this type of work with their documented conditions.
Multi-Service AI Implementation 
The Claude AI integration is designed to support multiple services beyond the core TDIU report generation: 
1. Document Analysis Service 
Additional prompt templates will be created for the Document Analysis Service: 
You are assisting in generating a TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) report for a veteran's attorney. You have analyzed medical and employment records and now need to generate structured sections for the final report. 
Based on the following analysis data: 
[ANALYSIS_JSON] 
Please generate the following report sections: 
1. Medical Evidence Summary (2-3 paragraphs describing key conditions and supporting evidence) 
2. Vocational Impact Analysis (2-3 paragraphs on how conditions affect employment capability) 
3. Employment History Assessment (1-2 paragraphs on past work and inability to continue) 
4. Educational Factors (1 paragraph on educational background and transferable skills) 
5. Key Limitations (bulleted list of functional limitations with citation to supporting evidence) 
6. VA Criteria Application (1-2 paragraphs applying VA regulations to the evidence) 
7. Conclusion (1 paragraph summarizing eligibility for TDIU) 
Format your response in professional language appropriate for a legal document. Include specific citations to evidence where appropriate using this format: (Source: Document Name, Page X).
2. VA Brief Templates 
Specialized prompts for the VA Brief Templates service: 
3. Medical Terms Translation 
Specialized prompts for the Medical Terms Translation service: 
You are analyzing a comprehensive set of medical records to create an organized, searchable document library. Please: 
1. Create a chronological timeline of all medical visits and events 
2. Categorize each document by type (progress note, lab result, imaging, etc.) 
3. Identify all healthcare providers and their specialties 
4. Extract all diagnoses and link to supporting evidence 
5. Create a medication history with dosages and dates 
6. Identify key evidence related to functional limitations 
7. Cross-reference related documents 
Format your analysis as structured JSON that can be used to organize a comprehensive medical record library. 
You are customizing a VA brief template for a specific case. The template is for a [TEMPLATE_TYPE] argument. Given the following case information: 
[CASE_DETAILS] 
Please generate appropriate language for each section of the template: 
1. Introduction: Describe the specific issue and requested relief 
2. Factual Background: Summarize relevant facts for this specific argument 
3. Legal Standard: Adapt the standard legal language to this specific case 
4. Analysis: Apply the facts to the legal standard for this case 
5. Conclusion: State the requested outcome based on the analysis 
Ensure the language is professional, persuasive, and specific to this veteran's circumstances while following the template structure.
Monitoring and Optimization 
The Claude AI integration will include comprehensive monitoring and optimization: 
1. Usage Monitoring 
Track token usage per document 
Monitor processing time 
Record error rates and types 
Analyze response quality 
2. Cost Optimization 
Implement batching for multiple documents 
Use chunking for large documents 
Optimize prompt design for token efficiency 
Implement caching where appropriate 
3. Quality Improvement 
Regular prompt refinement 
Sample-based human review 
Feedback loop for error correction 
Version control for prompts 
4. Performance Metrics 
Processing time per document 
You are translating complex medical terminology into plain language that clearly connects to VA disability criteria. For the following medical terms: 
[MEDICAL_TERMS] 
For each term provide: 
1. Plain language explanation 
2. Functional impact description 
3. Relevance to VA disability criteria 
4. Example of how this would affect daily activities 
5. Example of how this would affect work capabilities 
Format your response as structured JSON with sections for each medical term. Use language appropriate for a non-medical audience while maintaining clinical accuracy.
Cost per document 
Accuracy rates 
Human intervention rates
