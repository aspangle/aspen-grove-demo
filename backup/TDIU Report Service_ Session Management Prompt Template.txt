Guidelines for Effective Session Management 
1. Keep CloudFormation Up to Date: Update your CloudFormation template after each session toreflect new resources 
2. Be Specific About Goals: Clearly state what you want to accomplish in each session 
3. Limit Previous Accomplishments: List only the most relevant 2-3 accomplishments from previoussessions 
4. Include Business Context: Mention if your current focus relates to a specific service from thebusiness plan 
5. Ask for Step-by-Step Guidance: Request clear, actionable steps that match your technicalknowledge level 
Additional Context (Optional) 
If your goal requires specific additional context, you can include it after your main prompt: 
Variation for Technical Challenges 
If you're facing a specific technical issue, modify the template: 
To summarize today's progress: 
1. We [accomplishment 1] 
2. We [accomplishment 2] 
3. We [accomplishment 3] 
For our next session, we should focus on: 
1. [Next step 1] 
2. [Next step 2] 
3. [Next step 3] 
I'll update the CloudFormation template with these changes for our next session. 
Additional context:
